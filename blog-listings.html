    <h1>What do we like to see in God</h1>
    <small>November, 2022</small>


    <p>Let's get this out of the way first, to avoid any confusion later. I am not an atheist. I do believe in a creator
      and believes that every creature has an essense of God in himself.
      We want someone to rely on, to make us feel safe, to assure us that everything's going to be fine. And who will be
      the perfect candidate for this other than the one who created us. The God. We tell ourselves that there is someone
      who has created us. And then its a no brainer for us to feel that since there is someone who created everything,
      he is responsible for us. We can share things with him, tell him our wishes and hope that he will fulfil them for
      us. Because we are his children right. Nobody wants to feel alone, rootless, a being without any origin. Everybody
      wants to feel a belongingness. And God comes to our rescue.</p>

    <p>
      The thoughts I am writing here are not particular related to any specific religion. They are related to God in
      general.
      And one example of how badly we want support is wanting to be under the guidance of gurus, preachers, monks and
      anyone we think are closer to God. Or may be the reincarnations of God.
      I think we can make each others' life easier by being available for each other as per our capabilities. By being
      kind and compassionate to one another. Thus, providing more options to one another for the support that all of us
      intend to seek. I am not saying that we will be the God for each other when we do that. I am just saying that if
      we try to be there for others then it will take some time before someone can feel that he has nowhere to go, no
      one to turn to.
      Even after all this, may be someone still seek the company of his God so that he can be himself, share things
      without any filters and judgement. Its fine because not everyone can share everything with anyone right? God will
      always be there for us. Let's just make God work easier and be there for each other as well.
      It will make a difference.</p>
